Various OpenSource Projects in Computational Intelligence/Machine Learning- Applied to the Xpilot AI Platform

"XPilot is an open-source 2-dimensional space combat simulator which is playable over the internet. Multiple players can connect to a central XPilot server and compete in many varieties of game play, such as free-for-all combat, capture-the-flag, or team combat. Each player controls a space-ship that can turn, thrust, and shoot. There is often a variety of weapons and ship upgrades available on the particular map in which they play. The game uses synchronized client/server networking to allow for solid network play."

The source code is available and the Artificial Intelligence methods are made clear to be able to be utilized by the programmer to control a ship (bot) for live autonomous agent training.

Different theories/systems in Computational Intelligence are implemented in the various files, spanning, but not limted to: 

Neural Networks, Fuzzy Expert Systems, Rule Based Expert Systems, and Genetic Algorithms 

An input file is provided for the Neural Network Training, the weights of that training are used in the XPilot Neural Network controller.
